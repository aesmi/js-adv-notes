# Advanced JavaScript notes

## Code consoles
Web development consoles with collaborative features.

For performance, it is often best to switch off live updates.

### [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/)
Can add Firebug Lite as an external resource (top left):

```
https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js#startOpened=true
```

Notes:

* No code validation.


### [liveweave.com](https://liveweave.com/)
Can add Firebug Lite to HTML `<head>`:

```html
<script src="https://getfirebug.com/firebug-lite.js#startOpened=true"></script>
```

Notes:

* Firebug Lite only works in Firefox, Edge and IE (not Chrome-based browsers).
* Login does not appear to work?
* JavaScript validation does not include ES6 syntax.
* If initial "Hello Weaver" appears on a saved page, try refreshing.

### [Plunker](http://plnkr.co/)
Can add Firebug Lite to HTML as above.
